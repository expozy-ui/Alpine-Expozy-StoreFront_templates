                    <p>(a) to obtain confirmation as to whether personal data relating to him/her are being processed;</p>
                    <p>(b) to obtain access to the personal data being processed and to detailed information regarding the processing and his/her rights.</p>
                    <p><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong>The right to rectification – to request the correction or completion of his/her personal data if they are inaccurate or incomplete;</p>
                    <p><strong>4.&nbsp;</strong>The right to erasure – to request the erasure of his/her personal data, if the grounds for this provided for in the Regulation are present;</p>
                    <p><strong>5.&nbsp;</strong>Right to restrict the processing of personal data – to require HOTEL Expozy SOFIA to restrict the processing of his/her personal data within the framework provided for in the Regulation, if the grounds for this provided for therein are present;</p>
                    <p><strong>6.&nbsp;</strong>Notification of third parties – the right to require HOTEL Expozy SOFIA to notify third parties to whom his/her personal data has been disclosed of any correction, deletion or restriction of the processing of his/her personal data, unless this is impossible or requires disproportionate efforts from HOTEL Expozy SOFIA;</p>
                    <p><strong>7.&nbsp;</strong>Right to data portability – to receive the personal data concerning him/her, which he/she has provided to HOTEL Expozy SOFIA, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and to transfer these data to another administrator without hindrance from HOTEL Expozy SOFIA.</p>
                    <p>The right to data portability applies when the following two conditions are simultaneously met:</p>
                    <p>(a) the processing is based on consent or a contractual obligation; and</p>
                    <p>(b) the processing is carried out by automated means.</p>
                    <p>If technically feasible, the data subject has the right to obtain the direct transfer of personal data from HOTEL Expozy SOFIA to another controller.

                    <p><strong>8.&nbsp;</strong>Rights in automated individual decision-making, including profiling – not to be subject to an automated decision based solely on automated processing (i.e. processing without human intervention), including profiling within the meaning of the Regulation, which produces legal effects concerning the Data Subject or similarly significantly affects him/her, unless there are grounds for this provided for in the Regulation and suitable safeguards are provided for to protect the rights and freedoms and legitimate interests of the Data Subject. Such safeguards are at least the right to human intervention on the part of HOTEL Expozy SOFIA, the right of the Data Subject to express his/her point of view and to contest the decision.</p>
                    <p>If such a decision, including profiling, is taken in relation to the Data Subject, the Data Subject shall have the right, in each specific case, to receive from HOTEL Expozy SOFIA separately essential information about the logic involved, the significance and the intended consequences of such processing for him or her, as well as about the manner in which he or she may exercise the rights under this point.</p>
                    <p><strong>9.&nbsp;</strong>Right to withdraw consent to processing – where the processing of personal data is based solely on consent given by the Data Subject, the Data Subject may withdraw his or her consent at any time. Such withdrawal shall not affect the lawfulness of the processing based on the consent given up to the moment of its withdrawal;</p>
                    <h4>RIGHT TO OBJECT</h4>
                    <p><strong>Art. 18.&nbsp;</strong>The data subject shall have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, to processing of personal data concerning him or her, including profiling within the meaning of the Regulation, which is based on public interest, exercise of official authority or the legitimate interests of HOTEL Expozy SOFIA or a third party. In such cases, HOTEL Expozy SOFIA shall cease processing the personal data unless it demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</p>
                    <p><strong>Art. 19. (1)&nbsp;</strong>The data subject may exercise his/her rights related to the protection of personal data by personally submitting a relevant written request to HOTEL Expozy SOFIA - submitted personally by the Subject to the address specified in Art. 23 of this Policy or by means of a notarized request sent by mail.</p>
