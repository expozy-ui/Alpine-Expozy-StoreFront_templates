                    A “cookie” is a small text file consisting of letters and numbers that will be stored on your computer, mobile phone or other user terminal equipment through which you access the Internet. A cookie is installed through a request submitted by the user terminal to the server or to a third party server.

                    These files make it possible, in general, to recognize the user's terminal and present content in a way that is relevant, adapted to the user's preferences. Cookies ensure that users have a good time and support efforts to provide services that are as well tailored to users as possible, for example regarding online privacy preferences, the shopping cart or relevant advertisements. They are also used in the preparation of anonymous aggregated statistics that help us understand how users use our websites, which allows us to improve the structure and content without identifying each individual user.

                    We use two types of cookies: session and persistent. Session cookies are temporary files that remain on a terminal until the user session ends or the application is closed. Persistent cookies remain on the user's terminal for the period specified by the cookie parameters or until they are manually deleted by the user.

                    In general, an application used to access web pages allows the storage of cookies or similar technologies on the terminal by default. They are stored for the periods described in the table in section 11 below. These settings can be changed in such a way that the automatic management of cookies is blocked by your web browser or the user is informed when cookies are sent to the terminal. Detailed information on the possibilities and methods of managing cookies can be found in the settings area of ​​the application (web browser). Restricting the use of cookies may affect some of the functionalities of the site.

                    Why are cookies and/or other similar technologies important to the Internet?

                </p>
                <p>

                    Cookies and/or other similar technologies are central to the effective functioning of the Internet, helping to create a friendly, targeted experience and a stay that is adapted to the interests and preferences of each user. Refusing or disabling cookies may make some sites or parts of sites unusable.
                    <br>

                    Disabling cookies does not mean that you will no longer receive, in accordance with the law, online advertising, but only that it will no longer be able to take into account your preferences and interests, visible from your browsing behavior on the Internet.
                    <br>

                    Examples of important needs for the use of cookies (where the user's permission is not required through the profile):
                    <br>

                    Content and services tailored to user preferences - product and service categories.
                    <br>

                    Offers tailored to user interests
                    <br>

                    <span class="font-semibold">Saving passwords</span>
                    <br>

                    Saving child protection filters for Internet content (family mode options, safe search function).
                    <br>

                    Ad frequency capping – limiting the number of times a given ad is shown to a given user on a site.
                    <br>

                    Providing relevant advertising to the user.
                    <br>

                    Measuring, optimizing, and adapting analytics features – such as confirming a certain level of website traffic, what type of content is viewed, and how a user enters the website (e.g., through search engines, directly, from other websites, etc.). Websites process these analytics for use in improving services for users.

                <p>

                    In general, browsers have integrated privacy settings that provide different levels of cookie acceptance, validity period and automatic deletion after the user has visited a particular site.
                    <br>

                    Other security aspects related to cookies:
                    <br>

                    Customize your browser's cookie settings to reach your comfortable level of security when using cookies.
                    <br>

                    If you are the only person using a particular computer, you can specify whether you want a longer period of time for storing browsing history and personal access data.
                    <br>

                    If you share access to a particular computer, you can consider setting your browser so that it deletes your individual browsing data every time you close the browser. This is one option for accessing sites that use cookies and for deleting all information from the visit at the end of the session.
