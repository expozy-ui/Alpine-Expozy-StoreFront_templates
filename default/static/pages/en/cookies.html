                <p>This policy applies to cookies and other similar technologies used, as applicable, on websites and applications managed by WEBSITE LLC, with UIC 0000001 and tax number BG 000000001, (hereinafter referred to as WEBSITE).<br>
                    <span class="font-semibold">Cookies are used for the following purposes:</span><br>
                    for the functioning of the site,<br>
                    for analyzing the behavior of site visitors,<br>
                    for advertising.<br>
                    <br>
                    This policy is complemented by a general data protection policy, which we recommend that you read, which includes additional useful information, including regarding the responsibilities of the Data Protection Officer, all purposes of personal data processing, your rights, as well as their limitations and exceptions, etc.<br>
                    Adequate protection of personal data is an important task. Our desire is to be as clear and transparent as possible in resolving and dealing with the issue. For any questions, please contact us at <a href="mailto:data.protection@website.com">GDPR@</a>WEBSITE.COM.

                <p class="strong font-semibold">What are cookies?</p>
                <p>A “cookie” is a small text file consisting of letters and numbers that will be stored on your computer, mobile phone or other user terminal equipment through which you access the Internet. A cookie is installed through a request submitted by the user terminal to the server or to a third party server.</p>
                <p class="strong font-semibold">What are cookies used for?</p>
                <p>These files make it possible, in general, to recognize the user's terminal and present content in a way that is relevant, adapted to the user's preferences. Cookies ensure that users have a good time and support efforts to provide services that are as well tailored to users as possible, for example regarding online privacy preferences, the shopping cart or relevant advertisements. They are also used in the preparation of anonymous aggregated statistics that help us understand how users use our websites, which allows us to improve the structure and content without identifying each individual user.</p>
                <p class="strong font-semibold">What cookies do we use?
                </p>
                <p>We use two types of cookies: session and persistent. Session cookies are temporary files that remain on a terminal until the user's session ends or the application is closed. Persistent cookies remain on the user's terminal for the period specified by the cookie's parameters or until they are manually deleted by the user.</p>
                <p class="strong">How are cookies used by this site?
                </p>
                <p>A visit to this site may leave the following types of cookies:<br>
                    Cookies are strictly necessary for the operation of the site<br>
                    Analytics cookies<br>
                    Advertising cookies.<br>
                    <br>
                    Cookies and/or other strictly necessary similar technologies are essential for the proper functioning of the site, being set on your device when you enter the website or as a result of actions taken on the site, as the case may be. You can set your browser to block cookies, but in this case, some sections of the site will not work properly.<br><br>
                </p>
                <p class="strong font-semibold">Do cookies or similar technologies contain personal data?</p>
                <p>Cookies or other similar technologies do not require personal information in order to be used and in many cases do not even identify the person of the Internet users. However, there are situations where personal data may be collected through the use of cookies to facilitate certain functions of the user or to provide the user with an experience that is tailored to his preferences. This data is encrypted in a way that makes it impossible for unauthorized access to it.</p>
                <p class="strong font-semibold">What are other similar technologies?</p>
                <p>There are other technologies that can be used for the same purposes as cookies.<br>This website uses Local Storage as a similar technology.</p>
                <p class="strong font-semibold">Blocking cookies</p>
                <p>If you choose to block cookies, some features of the site will be disabled, and this may cause some malfunctions or errors when using our site. For example, blocking cookies may prevent you from:<br>
                    you buy online<br>
                    to identify yourself when logging into your account<br>

                <p class="strong font-semibold">Managing cookie preferences</p>
                <p>In general, an application used to access web pages allows the storage of cookies or similar technologies on the terminal by default. They are stored for the periods described in the table in section 11 below. These settings can be changed in such a way that the automatic management of cookies is blocked by your web browser or the user is informed when cookies are sent to the terminal. Detailed information on the possibilities and methods of managing cookies can be found in the settings area of the application (web browser). Restricting the use of cookies may affect some of the functionalities of the site.</p>
                <p class="strong">Why are cookies and/or other similar technologies important to the Internet?</p>
                <p>Cookies and/or other similar technologies are central to the efficient functioning of the Internet, helping to create a friendly, targeted experience and a stay that is adapted to the interests and preferences of each user. Refusing or disabling cookies may make some sites or parts of sites unusable.<br>
                    Disabling cookies does not mean that you will no longer receive online advertising, as required by law, but only that it will no longer be able to take into account your preferences and interests, as evident from your browsing behavior.<br>
                    Examples of essential need for cookies (which do not require user permission through the account):<br>
                    Content and services tailored to user preferences – product and service categories.<br>
                    Offers tailored to users' interests<br>
                    Remembering passwords<br>
                    Saving child protection filters for Internet content (family mode options, safe search function).<br>
                    Ad frequency capping – limiting the number of times a given ad is displayed to a specific user on a site.<br>
                    Providing user-friendly advertising.<br>
                    The measurement, optimization and adaptation of analytics features – such as confirming a certain level of traffic on the website, what type of content is viewed and how a user enters the website (for example: through search engines, directly, from other websites, etc.). Websites process these analytics for use in improving services for the benefit of users.</p>
                <p class="strong font-semibold">Security and privacy issues</p>
                <p>Browsers generally have integrated privacy settings that provide different levels of cookie acceptance, validity period, and automatic deletion after the user has visited a particular site.<br>
                    <span class="font-semibold">Other security aspects related to cookies:<br></span>
                    Customize your browser settings regarding cookies to reach your comfortable level of security when using cookies.<br>
                    If you are the only person using a particular computer, you can specify whether you want to store browsing history and personal access data for a longer period of time.<br>
                    If you share access to a computer, you may want to consider setting your browser to delete your individual browsing data each time you close the browser. This is one option for accessing sites that use cookies and for deleting all information from the visit at the end of the session.
