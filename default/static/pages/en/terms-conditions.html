                        <p><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;To be informed of the rights arising from the law, primarily through the platform's interface on the Internet;</p>

                        <p><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;Exercise their right of withdrawal, where applicable, under the Consumer Protection Act.</p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 4.</strong>&nbsp;The Supplier on the platform organizes the delivery of the goods and guarantees the rights of the Users, as provided for by law, within the framework of good faith, accepted in practice, consumer or commercial law criteria and conditions.</p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 5. (1)</strong>&nbsp;Users conclude a contract for the purchase and sale of goods with the Supplier on the WEBSITE.COM platform. The contract is concluded and stored in the Supplier's database on the platform.</p>

                        <p><strong>(2)</strong>&nbsp;By virtue of the contract for the purchase and sale of goods concluded with the Users, the Provider on the platform undertakes to organize the delivery and transfer of ownership to the User of the goods specified by him through the interface on the platform. Users have the right to correct errors in entering information no later than sending the statement for the conclusion of the contract to the Provider on the platform.</p>

                        <p><strong>(3)</strong>&nbsp;Users pay the Platform Provider a fee for the delivered goods in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the Platform and these General Terms and Conditions. The fee is in the amount of the price announced on the Platform. In the event of a technical error in the price, the Provider shall immediately notify the User of the correct price of the product and shall have the right to refuse an order placed due to an incorrect indication of its real price.&nbsp;The Platform is a catalogue in nature, and the products presented therein do not constitute an offer to conclude a contract. An offer to conclude a contract is provided by the User upon completion of the relevant order.</p>

                        <p><strong>(4)</strong> To place an order for some of the products on the platform, the User must pay an advance deposit in an amount determined by the Supplier. In the event that a given product falls within the scope of the previous sentence, the User will be informed of this before placing an order for the product in question, through an information notice on the product page on the platform.</p>

                        <p><strong>(5) </strong>The price of goods on the Platform can be indicated in several ways:</p>

                        <p>- standalone selling price, without additional indication of the MSRP (Supplier's Recommended Price) or old discounted and crossed out price;</p>

                        <p>- selling price, as well as the MSRP (Recommended Retail Price) indicated to it. MSRP is a recommended retail price for products, which is provided by a manufacturer and/or supplier. MSRP can also be called MSRP (end-user price) or recommended retail price. The presence of a MSRP does not mean that there is a discount or promotion for the specific product. MSRP&nbsp;is an additional information reference for the User regarding the prices that the manufacturer and/or supplier recommends. Each selling price, even if a MSRP is indicated to it, is determined independently by the administrator of this website.;</p>

                        <p>- selling price, as well as the old reduced and crossed out price indicated to it. The old (reduced) price is the lowest price for the specific product for the last 30 days. In certain situations, the old (reduced) price may not be the lowest price for the last 30 days in case there is a progressive price reduction within the meaning of Art. 65, para. 5 of the Consumer Protection Act - In the case of a progressive price reduction, the previous price is the price without reduction before the first price reduction. According to Art. 65, para. 2 of the Consumer Protection Act, the Previous Price is the lowest price of the good or service that the trader applied during a period not shorter than 30 days before the date of the price reduction in the same retail outlet, website or application. Discounts on the Platform are marked with a label indicating the percentage of the reduction.</p>

                        <p><strong>(6) </strong>The Supplier on the Platform provides Users with Price Protection. Price Protection has the following application and meaning - if the User purchases a product from the Platform and subsequently discovers that the amount paid by him has become lower within 7 days of placing the order, the Supplier will add the difference as a monetary value to his profile. For this purpose, the User must contact the 24/7 customer support within these 7 days. Price Protection is applicable only to the sales price indicated on the Platform at the time of the order. Price Protection is not valid in the event that the sales price is further reduced by the User by using a promo code and/or voucher, as well as in the event of a special individual price reduction provided to the specific User.</p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 6. (1)</strong>&nbsp;The User and the Supplier on the platform agree that all statements between them in connection with the conclusion and performance of the purchase and sale contract may be made electronically and through electronic statements within the meaning of the Electronic Document and Electronic Signature Act and Art. 11 of the Electronic Commerce Act.</p>

                        <p><strong>(2)</strong>&nbsp;It is assumed that the electronic statements made by the Users of the site were made by the persons specified in the data provided by the User upon registration, if the User has entered the relevant username and password for access.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p><strong>IV. REGISTRATION FOR USE</strong></p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 7. (1)</strong>&nbsp;In order to use the Website to conclude contracts for the purchase and sale of goods, the User must enter a name and password for remote access chosen by him or authenticate himself through his Facebook or Google account, which is deemed to have accepted these general terms and conditions.&nbsp;Acceptance of these general terms and conditions is also made upon finalization of each order by the User.</p>

                        <p><strong>(2)</strong>&nbsp;The name and password for remote access are determined by the User, by completing an online registration on the Provider's website in the platform, in accordance with the procedure specified therein. Users have the opportunity to place orders for delivery of goods and a profile from the social networks Facebook and Google.</p>

                        <p><strong>(3)</strong>&nbsp;By filling in their data in the user basket and clicking the "Complete order" button, the User declares that they are familiar with these general terms and conditions, agree with their content and undertake to unconditionally comply with them.</p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 8.&nbsp;(1)</strong>&nbsp;Users primarily use the interface of the Supplier's page on the platform to conclude purchase and sale contracts for the goods offered by the suppliers on the platform.</p>

                        <p><strong>(2)</strong>&nbsp;In cases of ordering goods without registration by the User, the latter accepts these general terms and conditions at the moment of finalizing the order.</p>

                        <p><strong>(1)&nbsp;</strong>Log in to the system to place orders on the platform.</p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 10. (1)&nbsp;</strong>The Supplier and the Users shall conclude separate contracts for the purchase and sale of the goods requested by the Users, regardless of whether they are selected with one electronic statement and from one list of goods for purchase.</p>

                        <p><strong>(2)&nbsp;</strong>The Supplier may organize the delivery of the goods ordered under the separate purchase and sale contracts together and simultaneously.</p>

                        <p><strong>(3)&nbsp;</strong>The rights of the Users in relation to the delivered goods are exercised separately for each purchase and sale agreement. The exercise of rights in relation to the delivered goods does not affect and has no effect on the purchase and sale agreements of other goods. In the event that the User has the status of a consumer within the meaning of the Consumer Protection Act, the exercise of the right to withdraw from the contract for the purchase and sale of certain goods does not affect the contracts for the purchase and sale of other goods delivered to the consumer. Consumers benefit from a legal guarantee of conformity of the goods with the sales contract.</p>

                        <p><strong>(4)</strong>&nbsp;In the case of delivery of goods that are delivered promotionally together with other goods in a set, the delivery and return rules of the respective set, as announced in the product profile in the online store, shall apply with priority.</p>

                        <p><strong>(2)</strong>&nbsp;With regard to goods that are delivered promotionally together with other goods in a set, the price for the set applies only to its entirety and is indivisible for individual goods in the set.</p>

                        <p><strong>(3)</strong>&nbsp;In the event that the Supplier accepts the return of one item from a set under para. 2, the User has the right to be refunded an amount for the returned item from the set, which is proportional to the ratio between the prices of the items from the set in the Supplier's online store when they are not offered in a set with each other.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p><strong>VII. SPECIAL CLAUSES APPLICABLE TO PERSONS WHO HAVE THE CAPACITY OF CONSUMER WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT&nbsp;AND THE ACT ON THE PROVISION OF DIGITAL CONTENT AND DIGITAL SERVICES AND ON THE SALE OF GOODS</strong></p>

                        <p><strong>1<em>.</em></strong>&nbsp;for the provision of services where the service is provided in full, when the contract provides for an obligation for the consumer to pay, and the performance has begun with the consumer's express prior consent and confirmation that he knows that he will lose his right of withdrawal once the contract is fully performed by the trader;</p>

This rule does not apply to virtual funds loaded into the virtual wallet via a voucher, in which case the right of withdrawal applies only to the purchased voucher and within the relevant time limits after its purchase.</p>

                        <p><strong>(5)</strong>&nbsp;When exercising the right of withdrawal, the costs of returning the delivered goods are at the expense of the consumer on the basis of Art. 55, para. 2 of the ZPA. The Supplier is not obliged to reimburse the additional costs for the initial delivery of the goods when the consumer has explicitly chosen a method of delivery of the goods other than the free standard delivery offered by the Supplier.</p>

                        <p><strong>(6)</strong>&nbsp;The User undertakes to store the goods received from the Supplier on the platform and to ensure the preservation of their quality and safety during the period under para. 1.</p>

                        <p><strong>(7)</strong>&nbsp;The Consumer may exercise his right to withdraw from the contract with the Supplier by sending a written statement to the Supplier using the standard withdrawal form or via the module provided on the Supplier's website. The goods should be sent cash on delivery to the Complaints Department.&nbsp;Goods sent cash on delivery will not be accepted by the Supplier.</p>

                        <p><strong>(8)</strong>&nbsp;Where the platform provider has not offered to collect the goods himself, he may withhold payment of the amounts to the consumer until he has received the goods or until the consumer provides proof that he has sent the goods back, whichever is earlier.</p>

                        <p><strong>(9)</strong>&nbsp;In the case of delivery of goods that are delivered together with other goods in a set (so-called bundle goods), when exercising the Consumer's right of withdrawal under this article and the requirements of the Consumer Protection Act,&nbsp;The Consumer must return the entire set, as he received it and in commercial form. In the event that some of the goods that are part of the bundle product are not subject to return according to the regulations, the Consumer agrees that the entire bundle product is not subject to return.</p>

                        <p><strong>(10)</strong>&nbsp;Irrespective of the above hypotheses, the Consumer undertakes to return the goods in commercial form. Commercial form means a form that allows the subsequent sale of the goods as new. The unpacking of the goods should not have led to an obvious violation of the commercial form of the goods. In the event of a violation of the commercial form of the goods, the Supplier has the right, at its discretion, to refuse to accept withdrawal from the contract or to charge the Consumer the costs of returning the goods in commercial form. According to Art. 55, para. 4 of the ZPA, the Consumer is liable for the reduced value of the goods caused by their testing, other than what is necessary to establish their nature, characteristics and proper functioning.</p>

                        <p><strong>(11)</strong>&nbsp;In the event of exercising the right of withdrawal under this article, the User is deemed to have also exercised the right of withdrawal with respect to the bonus content belonging to the product.</p>

                        <p><strong>(12)</strong> The right of withdrawal also applies to books, only if the book shows no signs of use and is in a commercially preserved condition, and if the book was wrapped in foil – the packaging has not been opened. The performance of the contract for a purchased book begins from the moment of opening the packaging, at which time the consumer loses his right of withdrawal and the consumer expressly agrees to this.</p>

                        <p><strong>(13)</strong> When returning the goods, the User undertakes to return it together with the complete set received, as well as all accompanying documents - receipt, invoice,&nbsp;handover report, warranty card (if any have been issued).</p>

                        <p><strong>(14) </strong>When returning the goods, the User undertakes to return all gifts that he received together with the ordered goods, in case such were sent by the Supplier.</p>

                        <p><strong>(15)</strong> When purchasing from a legal entity, the provisions of the Obligations and Contracts Act shall apply, which derogate from these General Terms and Conditions.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p class="text-center"><strong>VIII. PERFORMANCE OF THE CONTRACT</strong></p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 17. (1)</strong>&nbsp;The delivery time of the goods is determined for each good separately upon conclusion of the contract with the consumer through the Supplier's website on the platform. For each specific good, the Consumer is notified immediately before finalizing the order on the platform of approximately how many days its delivery will take. The days required for delivery indicated on the platform are indicative and the Supplier does not guarantee them, but guarantees that it will do everything possible to deliver the goods on the specified days.</p>

                        <p><strong>(2)&nbsp;</strong>In case the User and the Supplier on the platform have not set a delivery time, the delivery time of the goods is 30 calendar days, starting from the date following the sending of the User's order to the Supplier via the Supplier's website on the platform.</p>

                        <p><strong>(3)</strong>&nbsp;If the Supplier on the platform cannot fulfill the contract due to not having the ordered goods, he is obliged to notify the user of this and refund the amounts paid by him. In such cases, the Supplier could not be held liable to the extent that he notified the User of the depleted quantities.</p>

                        <p><strong>(4)&nbsp;</strong>The Supplier may refuse to process the order when there are reasonable doubts that the order is inauthentic, including that it does not originate from the User described in it or when the product requested with the order is temporarily unavailable due to exhaustion of quantities or other technical reasons, in which case the Supplier shall notify the User by email or telephone and refund the amounts paid by him. The Supplier may also refuse to process an order when the number or volume of the ordered items exceeds their usual consumption by a customer-consumer within the meaning of the ZPA and there is reason to believe that the order is made for the purpose of resale and does not fall within the scope of consumer purchase and sale.</p>

                        <p><strong>(5)&nbsp;</strong>In case of inaccurate data provided by the User for the delivery address and telephone number or the User's absence at the address, as well as in case of impossibility to deliver the goods for reasons beyond the Supplier's control, the goods are returned and remain in the Supplier's warehouses. In this case, the goods are not kept for the User, unless they have been paid in advance. In case of prepaid goods, the same is kept within 15 days of its return, and after the expiration of this period and if the User does not request it from the Supplier, the Supplier will return the payment received, with the exception of the amount spent on delivery and storage. In case of inaccurate or incorrect data provided by the User for the delivery address, &nbsp;in which case the goods are sent to the wrong address, the costs for a courier service to redirect the shipment are at the expense of the User.</p>

                        <p><strong>(6)</strong> In the event that the goods are not delivered to the User within the specified delivery period, the User is not due compensation. Reasons that would delay delivery beyond the days specified on the platform are: workload and number of orders for the period above average and above usual for the Supplier; faults in the courier company such as untimely organization of the courier, excessive workload of the courier, unpredictable technical and information problems with the courier or weather conditions hindering the courier; unpredictable technical problems in the Supplier's systems; faults in the Supplier's suppliers from which the latter supplies the product; bad weather conditions, etc. force majeure circumstances that would prevent the normal organizational activities of the Supplier.</p>

                        <p><strong>(7)</strong> In all cases, the Supplier guarantees and undertakes to deliver the goods to the User no more than 15 working days later than the estimated delivery days indicated on the platform.</p>

                        <p><strong>(8)</strong> For products with an individual or total value of 9.99&nbsp;euro or less that fall under the “Plus Products” program, the Supplier may refuse to accept the order. In the event that a product or products fall under the “Plus Products” program and their total value is equal to or less than 9.99&nbsp;euro within the meaning of the previous sentence, the User is notified via a message on the platform and is prevented from placing an order. In order to place the order, the User must add a product or products with a total value of at least 10&nbsp;euro.</p>

                        <p><strong>(9)</strong> Delivery is made to the User's door only if the total weight of the shipment (with all its components and parts) does not exceed 15 kg. In case the total weight of the shipment exceeds 15 kg, delivery is made to the ground floor of the specified address.</p>

                        <p><strong>(10)</strong> In the event that the specified delivery address is not accessible by car, delivery will be made to the location that the street allows as the final and closest point to the delivery address.</p>

                        <p><strong>(11)</strong> In the event that the User places an order for two or more products, each of which has a different delivery date and this date is more than 7 days away, the products are delivered with separate orders in order to receive them on time, unless the User explicitly notes when finalizing the order that he wishes to receive them together with the last available product.</p>

                        <p><strong>(12)</strong> For products that are upcoming releases (pre-order) and/or editions, as well as limited/special editions, the Provider does not guarantee sufficient availability for each User who has placed an order, nor does it guarantee that the products in question will be issued, released on the market and distributed by the Provider at all, as the latter depends entirely on the manufacturer and/or publisher. In the event that a User places an order for a product falling within the hypotheses of this paragraph and subsequently this product is not delivered to him due to insufficient availability, non-release or non-release on the market by the manufacturer or publisher, the Provider is not liable, and shall only notify the User of this circumstance.</p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 18.</strong>&nbsp;The platform provider undertakes to comply with all requirements established in Bulgarian legislation regarding the labeling, advertising and sale of food supplements.</p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 19.&nbsp;</strong>The Supplier informs the User about&nbsp;transport and courier costs&nbsp;immediately before completing the order, and the delivery price may vary depending on the product, method and delivery address selected by the User. In case of additional redirection of an already requested order by the User or in case of need to visit the requested address again, the User pays the delivery price in amounts determined according to the tariff of the respective courier. The conditions for free delivery, when any, do not apply in the event that the User requests a visit to an address at a time or range of the day specified by him.</p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 20. (1)</strong>&nbsp;The User must inspect the goods at the time of delivery and handover by the courier and, if they do not meet the requirements or have visible breakages and defects, refuse to accept them from the courier and immediately notify the Supplier on the platform.</p>

                        <p><strong>(2)</strong>&nbsp;If the User does not refuse the goods from the courier and does not notify the Supplier on the platform in accordance with para. 1, the goods are considered approved as complying with the requirements, except for hidden defects.</p>

                        <p><strong>(3)</strong> In the event that upon delivery of the goods the User wishes to refuse them and not accept them, the costs of transportation in both directions are at his expense.</p>

                        <p><strong>(4)</strong>&nbsp;In the event that the product purchased by the User is an e-book, the User is informed that e-books are objects of copyright, according to the legislation, and any actions of unregulated distribution constitute serious violations of the same, as well as a crime within the meaning of Section VII of the Criminal Code - crimes against intellectual property, for which crime a penalty of imprisonment of up to eight years and a fine of up to fifty thousand leva is provided.</p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 21.</strong>&nbsp;The Supplier shall provide the necessary service for the goods in accordance with the provisions of Section XIII. COMPLAINTS.</p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 22.</strong>&nbsp;For cases not regulated in this section, the rules of commercial sale set out in the Commerce Act&nbsp; the Consumer Protection Act and the Act on the Provision of Digital Content and Digital Services and on the Sale of Goods shall apply.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p><strong>IX. PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA</strong></p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 23. (1)&nbsp;</strong>The platform provider shall take measures to protect the User's personal data in accordance with the Personal Data Protection Act.</p>

                        <p><strong>(2)</strong>&nbsp;For reasons of security of the Users' personal data, the Provider on the platform will send the data only to the e-mail address that was specified by the Users at the time of registration.</p>

                        <p><strong>(3)</strong>&nbsp;The Platform Provider has the right to store data on the User's terminal communication device, unless the latter explicitly expresses his/her disagreement with this.</p>

                        <p><strong>(4)</strong>&nbsp;The User or Consumer agrees that the Platform Provider has the right to send electronic messages to the User or Consumer at any time, including a newsletter or offers to purchase goods, as long as the User or Consumer is registered in the Provider's e-store on the platform.</p>

                        <p><strong>(5)</strong>&nbsp;The User or Consumer agrees that the Platform Provider has the right to collect, store and process data on the User's or Consumer's behavior when using the Provider's e-store on the platform.</p>

                        <p><strong>(6)</strong>&nbsp;The Provider does not at any time retain data on credit and/or debit card(s) used by the User when purchasing goods from the platform. The User has the option to retain data on credit and/or debit card(s) used by him when purchasing goods from the platform, as the data on these credit and/or debit card(s) are not retained by the Provider, but are retained solely in the system of the banking institution that issued the process card. When retaining a credit and/or debit card(s), the User should use a 3D code if he intends to use the retained card again for the purpose of purchasing from the platform.</p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 24. (1)</strong>&nbsp;At any time, the Provider on the platform has the right to require the User to identify himself and to verify the authenticity of each of the circumstances and personal data declared during registration.</p>

                        <p><strong>(2)</strong>&nbsp;In the event that for any reason the User has forgotten or lost his/her username and password, the Platform Provider has the right to apply the announced "Procedure for lost or forgotten usernames and passwords".</p>

                        <p><strong>(3) </strong>In case of shortcomings regarding the protection and processing of the User's personal data, a detailed description is available in the Website's Privacy Policy.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p><strong>X. AMENDMENT AND ACCESS TO THE GENERAL TERMS</strong></p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 25. (1)</strong>&nbsp;These general terms and conditions may be amended by the Platform Provider, the date of their last revision being recorded in Art. 38 of these General Terms and Conditions.</p>

                        <p><strong>A)</strong>&nbsp;after their publication on the&nbsp;Provider's website on the platform and if the User, who has already accepted the previous revision, does not declare within 14 days of their publication that he rejects them;</p>

                        <p><strong>B)</strong>&nbsp;with their explicit&nbsp;acceptance by the User through his profile on the Provider's website on the platform.</p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 26.</strong>&nbsp;The Provider publishes these general terms and conditions together with all additions and amendments thereto.</p>

                        <p>• upon termination and declaration of liquidation or declaration of bankruptcy of one of the parties to the contract;</p>

                        <p>I. Right to withdraw from the contract at a distance or off-premises.</p>

                        <p>II. The withdrawal period is 30 days from the date on which you or a third party, other than the carrier and indicated by you, took possession of the goods.</p>

                        <p>To exercise your right of withdrawal, you must inform us of your decision to withdraw from the contract by an unequivocal statement (e.g. a letter sent by post, fax or e-mail) using the contact details provided on our website.</p>

                        <p>You may use the attached standard withdrawal form, but this is not mandatory. You may also fill in and submit the standard withdrawal form or another unambiguous withdrawal form electronically on our website. If you use this option, we will immediately send you a message on a durable medium (e.g. by e-mail) confirming receipt of the withdrawal.</p>

                        <p>To meet the withdrawal period, it is sufficient to send your communication regarding the exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.</p>
