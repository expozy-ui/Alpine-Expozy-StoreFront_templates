                        <p><strong>Art. 3.</strong>&nbsp;This website is an e-commerce platform, accessible at the Internet address www.WEBSITE.COM, through which Users have the opportunity to conclude purchase and delivery contracts for goods offered by the Supplier on the platform, including the following:</p>

                        <p><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;To register and create a profile to browse the Supplier's online store and use additional information services;</p>

                        <p><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;To browse goods, their characteristics, prices, and delivery conditions;</p>

                        <p><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;To make any payments related to concluded contracts, including through electronic payment means.</p>

                        <p><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;To receive information about new goods offered by the Supplier on the platform;</p>

                        <p><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;To make electronic statements related to the conclusion or execution of contracts with the Supplier on the platform through the page interface accessible on the Internet;</p>

                        <p><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;To be informed of rights arising from the law, primarily through the platform interface on the Internet;</p>

                        <p><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;To exercise the right of withdrawal, when applicable, under the Consumer Protection Act.</p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 4.</strong>&nbsp;The Supplier on the platform organizes the delivery of goods and guarantees the rights of Users provided by law, within the framework of good faith, criteria and conditions accepted in practice, consumer or commercial law.</p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 5. (1)</strong>&nbsp;Users conclude purchase contracts for goods with the Supplier on the WEBSITE.COM platform. The contract is concluded and stored in the Supplier's database on the platform.</p>

                        <p><strong>(2)</strong>&nbsp;Under the purchase contract concluded with Users, the Supplier on the platform undertakes to organize the delivery and transfer of ownership to the User of the goods specified by them through the platform interface. Users have the right to correct errors in entering information no later than making a statement for concluding a contract with the Supplier on the platform.</p>

                        <p><strong>(3)</strong>&nbsp;Users pay the platform Supplier remuneration for delivered goods according to the conditions specified on the platform and these general terms and conditions. The remuneration equals the price announced on the platform. In case of a technical price error, the Supplier immediately notifies the User of the correct product price and has the right to refuse an order due to incorrect pricing.&nbsp;The platform has the character of a catalog, and the products presented on it do not constitute an offer to conclude a contract. An offer to conclude a contract is made by the User at the moment of completing the respective order.</p>

                        <p><strong>(4)</strong> To place an order for some products on the platform, the User must pay an advance deposit in an amount determined by the Supplier. If a product falls within the scope of the previous sentence, the User will be informed of this before placing an order for the product in question, through an information notice on the product page on the platform.</p>

                        <p><strong>(5) </strong>The price of goods on the Platform may be indicated in several ways:</p>

                        <p>- standalone selling price, without additional indication of RRP (Recommended Retail Price) or old reduced and crossed-out price;</p>

                        <p>- selling price, along with the indicated RRP (Recommended Retail Price). RRP is the recommended retail selling price of products provided by the manufacturer and/or supplier. RRP may also be called RCP (Recommended Customer Price) or recommended retail price. The presence of RRP does not mean that there is a discount or promotion for the specific product. RRP&nbsp;is an additional informational guide for the User regarding prices recommended by the manufacturer and/or supplier. Each selling price, even if RRP is indicated, is determined independently by the administrator of this website;</p>

                        <p>- selling price, along with an old reduced and crossed-out price. The old (reduced) price is the lowest price for the specific product in the last 30 days. In certain situations, the old (reduced) price may not be the lowest price in the last 30 days if there is a progressive price reduction within the meaning of Art. 65, para. 5 of the Consumer Protection Act - In case of progressive price reduction, the previous price is the price without reduction before the first price reduction. According to Art. 65, para. 2 of the CPA, the Previous price is the lowest price of the goods or services that the trader has applied during a period of not less than 30 days before the date of the price reduction in the same commercial establishment, website, or application. Discounts on the Platform are marked with a label indicating the discount percentage.</p>

                        <p><strong>(6) </strong>The Supplier on the Platform provides Users with Price Protection. Price Protection has the following application and meaning - if the User purchases a product from the Platform and subsequently discovers that the amount paid has become lower within 7 days of placing the order, the Supplier will add the difference as a monetary value to their profile. For this purpose, the User needs to contact 24-hour customer support within these 7 days. Price Protection is applicable only to the selling price indicated on the Platform at the time of the order. Price Protection is not valid if the selling price is additionally reduced by the User through the use of a promo code and/or voucher, as well as in case of a special individual price reduction provided to the specific User.</p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 6. (1)</strong>&nbsp;The User and the Supplier on the platform agree that all statements between them in connection with the conclusion and execution of the purchase contract may be made electronically and through electronic statements within the meaning of the Electronic Document and Electronic Signature Act and Art. 11 of the Electronic Commerce Act.</p>

                        <p><strong>(2)</strong>&nbsp;It is assumed that electronic statements made by Users on the site are made by the persons indicated in the data provided by the User during registration, if the User has entered the corresponding name and password for access.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p><strong>IV. REGISTRATION FOR USE</strong></p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 7. (1)</strong>&nbsp;To use the platform for concluding purchase contracts for goods, the User must enter a name and password chosen by them for remote access or authenticate through their Facebook or Google profile, which is considered acceptance of these general terms and conditions.&nbsp;Acceptance of these general terms and conditions is also made when finalizing each order by the User.</p>

                        <p><strong>(2)</strong>&nbsp;The name and password for remote access are determined by the User through online registration on the Supplier's site on the platform, according to the procedure indicated therein. Users have the opportunity to place orders for goods delivery and through a profile from social networks Facebook and Google.</p>

                        <p><strong>(3)</strong>&nbsp;By filling in their data in the shopping cart and clicking the "Complete Order" button, the User declares that they are familiar with these general terms and conditions, agree with their content, and unconditionally undertake to comply with them.</p>

                        <p><strong>(4)</strong>&nbsp;The Supplier confirms the order placed by the User by email. An account is created for the User and contractual relations arise between them and the Supplier.</p>

                        <p><strong>(5)</strong>&nbsp;When registering or placing an order, the User undertakes to provide true and current data. The User undertakes to update the data indicated in the registration or order in a timely manner in case of changes.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p><strong>V. TECHNICAL STEPS FOR CONCLUDING A PURCHASE CONTRACT</strong></p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 8.&nbsp;(1)</strong>&nbsp;Users primarily use the Supplier's page interface on the platform to conclude purchase contracts for goods offered by suppliers on the platform.</p>

                        <p><strong>(2)</strong>&nbsp;In cases of ordering goods without registration by the User, the User accepts these general terms and conditions at the moment of finalizing the order.</p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 9.</strong>&nbsp;Users conclude the purchase contract for goods on the platform according to the following procedure:</p>

                        <p><strong>(1)&nbsp;</strong>Logging into the ordering system on the platform.</p>

                        <p><strong>(2)</strong>&nbsp;Selecting one or more goods offered by the Supplier on the platform and adding them to the shopping list.</p>

                        <p><strong>(3)&nbsp;</strong>Providing necessary data for identifying the User as a party to the contract.</p>

                        <p><strong>(4)&nbsp;</strong>Providing data for delivery;</p>

                        <p><strong>(5)</strong>&nbsp;Choosing a method and time for payment of the price.</p>

                        <p><strong>(6)</strong>&nbsp;Order confirmation;</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p><strong>VI. CONTRACT CONTENT</strong></p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 10. (1)&nbsp;</strong>The Supplier and Users conclude separate purchase contracts for goods ordered by Users, regardless of whether they were selected with one electronic statement and from one shopping list.</p>

                        <p><strong>(2)&nbsp;</strong>The Supplier may organize the delivery of goods ordered under separate purchase contracts together and simultaneously.</p>

                        <p><strong>(3)&nbsp;</strong>User rights in connection with delivered goods are exercised separately for each purchase contract. Exercise of rights in connection with delivered goods does not affect and has no effect on purchase contracts for other goods. If the User has the status of a consumer within the meaning of the Consumer Protection Act, the exercise of the right of withdrawal from the purchase contract for a specific product does not affect the purchase contracts for other goods delivered to the consumer. Consumers benefit from a statutory guarantee of conformity of the goods with the sales contract.</p>

                        <p><strong>(4)</strong>&nbsp;In case of delivery of goods delivered promotionally together with other goods in a set, the rules for delivery and return of the respective set apply with priority, as announced in the product profile in the online store.</p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 11.</strong>&nbsp;When exercising rights under the purchase contract, the User is obliged to indicate precisely and unambiguously the contract and the goods in respect of which they exercise their rights.</p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 12.&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;</strong>The User may pay the price for separate purchase contracts at once when placing the order or upon delivery.</p>

                        <p><strong>(2)</strong>&nbsp;Regarding goods delivered promotionally together with other goods in a set, the price for the set applies only to the whole set and is indivisible for individual items in the set.</p>

                        <p><strong>(3)</strong>&nbsp;If the Supplier accepts the return of one product from a set under para. 2, the User has the right to be refunded an amount for the returned product from the set, which is proportional to the ratio between the prices of the products from the set in the Supplier's online store when they are not offered in a set together.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p><strong>VII. SPECIAL CLAUSES APPLICABLE TO PERSONS WHO HAVE THE STATUS OF CONSUMER WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT&nbsp;AND THE ACT ON PROVISION OF DIGITAL CONTENT AND DIGITAL SERVICES AND SALE OF GOODS</strong></p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 13.&nbsp;</strong>The rules of this Section VII of these general terms and conditions apply only to Users for whom, according to the data provided for concluding the purchase contract or during registration, it can be concluded that they are consumers within the meaning of the Consumer Protection Act, the Electronic Commerce Act, the Act on Provision of Digital Content and Digital Services and Sale of Goods&nbsp;and/or Directive 2011/83/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2011.</p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 14. (1)</strong>&nbsp;The main characteristics of the goods offered by the Supplier on the platform are defined in each product's profile on the platform.</p>

                        <p><strong>(2)</strong>&nbsp;The price of goods including all taxes and fees is determined by the Supplier on the platform in each product's profile on the platform.</p>

                        <p><strong>(3)</strong>&nbsp;The value of postal or transport costs not included in the price of goods is determined by the Supplier on the platform and is provided as information to Users when selecting goods for concluding the purchase contract and before finalizing the order.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>In case of non-receipt by the User of a sent product more than once, the Supplier reserves the right to:</p>

                        <p>- charge transport costs for the User on each subsequent order;</p>

                        <p>- not provide the right of withdrawal from purchased goods for a period longer than 14 days;</p>

                        <p>- not provide gifts with subsequent orders of the User;</p>

                        <p>- refuse "Price Protection" if the User invokes it.</p>

                        <p><strong>(4)</strong>&nbsp;The methods of payment, delivery, and contract execution are determined in these general terms and conditions and the information provided to the User through the mechanisms on the platform.</p>

                        <p><strong>(5)</strong>&nbsp;The information provided to Users under this article is current at the time of its visualization on the platform before concluding the purchase contract.</p>

                        <p><strong>(6)</strong>&nbsp;Users agree that all information required by the Consumer Protection Act&nbsp;and the Act on Provision of Digital Content and Digital Services and Sale of Goods&nbsp;may be provided through the platform interface or by email.</p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 15. (1)</strong>&nbsp;The Consumer agrees that suppliers on the platform have the right to accept advance payment for purchase contracts concluded with the consumer and their delivery.</p>

                        <p><strong>(2)</strong>&nbsp;The Consumer independently chooses whether to pay the Supplier on the platform the price for goods delivery before or at the time of their delivery.</p>

                        <p><strong>(3)</strong>&nbsp;If the value of the Consumer's order is equivalent to or exceeds 10,000 euros, payment is made only by transfer or deposit to the Supplier's payment account.</p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 16. (1)&nbsp;</strong>The Consumer has the right, without owing compensation or penalty and without stating a reason, to withdraw from the concluded contract within 30 days.</p>

                        <p><strong>(2)</strong>&nbsp;The right of withdrawal under para. 1 does not apply in the following cases:</p>

                        <p><strong>1<em>.</em></strong>&nbsp;for the provision of services where the service has been fully provided, when the contract provides for an obligation for the consumer to pay, and performance has begun with the consumer's express prior consent and acknowledgment that they will lose their right of withdrawal after the contract has been fully performed by the trader;</p>

                        <p><strong>2<em>.</em></strong>&nbsp;for the supply of goods or services the price of which depends on fluctuations in the financial market which cannot be controlled by the trader and which may occur during the withdrawal period;</p>

                        <p><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;for the supply of goods made to the consumer's specifications or clearly personalized;</p>

                        <p><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;for the supply of goods which are liable to deteriorate or expire rapidly, such as food, beverages, and dietary supplements;</p>

                        <p><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;for the supply of sealed goods which were unsealed after delivery and which are not suitable for return due to health protection or hygiene reasons (such as earbuds, clothing, underwear, swimwear, socks, baby products, epilators, razors, toothbrushes, hairbrushes, medical devices having contact with the human body including stethoscopes and inhaler masks, etc.);</p>

                        <p><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;for the supply of goods which, after delivery, according to their nature, have been inseparably mixed with other goods;</p>

                        <p><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;for the supply of alcoholic beverages, the price of which has been agreed upon at the time of the conclusion of the sales contract, the delivery of which can only take place after 30 days from the conclusion of the contract, and the actual value of which depends on fluctuations in the market which cannot be controlled by the trader;</p>

                        <p><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;where the consumer has specifically requested a visit from the trader for the purpose of carrying out urgent repairs or maintenance; where, on such a visit, the trader provides services in addition to those specifically requested by the consumer or supplies goods other than replacement parts necessarily used in carrying out the repairs or maintenance, the right of withdrawal applies to those additional services or goods;</p>

                        <p><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;for the supply of sealed audio or sealed video recordings or sealed computer software which were unsealed after delivery, including activation codes for software licenses, features in software, or virtual payment means. The performance of the contract for the supply of sealed audio or video recordings or sealed computer software (including codes for content and digital content not on a tangible medium), which were unsealed after delivery, begins from the moment of unsealing and the consumer loses the right of withdrawal, expressly agreeing to this.</p>

                        <p><strong>10.</strong>&nbsp;for the supply of newspapers, periodicals, or magazines with the exception of subscription contracts for the supply of such publications;</p>

                        <p><strong>13.</strong> for the provision of digital content (<em><strong>such as e-books, electronic vouchers, electronic video games</strong></em>) which is not supplied on a tangible medium where the performance has begun and the contract obliges the consumer to pay, in cases where:&nbsp;a)&nbsp;the consumer has given prior express consent for the beginning of the performance during the withdrawal period;&nbsp;b)&nbsp;the consumer has acknowledged that they will thereby lose their right of withdrawal;&nbsp;c)&nbsp;the trader has provided confirmation in accordance with&nbsp;Art. 48, para. 2&nbsp;or&nbsp;Art. 49, para. 8 of the CPA. By accepting these Terms and Conditions and by placing an order, the consumer expressly gives prior consent for the beginning of performance and knows they will lose their right of withdrawal within the meaning of this point;</p>

                        <p><strong>14.</strong>&nbsp;perfumes, creams, and other bulk cosmetics that have been unsealed after delivery.</p>

                        <p><strong>(3)</strong>&nbsp;Where the supplier on the platform has not fulfilled their obligations to provide information defined in the Consumer Protection Act, the Consumer has the right to withdraw from the concluded contract within up to one year and 14 days from the date of receiving the goods. Where the information is provided to the consumer within the withdrawal period, that period shall begin to run from the date of its provision. The Consumer has the right to address the withdrawal statement under this article directly to the Supplier through the standard withdrawal form.</p>

                        <p><strong>(4)</strong>&nbsp;Where the Consumer has exercised their right of withdrawal from a distance contract or off-premises contract, the Supplier shall reimburse all sums received from the consumer, without undue delay and not later than 14 days from the date on which they were informed of the consumer's decision to withdraw from the contract&nbsp;and provided they have already received back the goods subject to the contract. The Supplier reimburses the sums received by bank transfer, unless the consumer has expressly agreed to the use of another means of payment, this sentence applying where the right of withdrawal has been exercised within 14 days of receiving the goods and the goods have been sent back to the Supplier within this 14-day period. Where the right of withdrawal is exercised after the 14th day of receiving the goods and/or the goods are sent back to the Supplier after the 14th day of their receipt by the Consumer, up to the 30th day of receipt, the sums paid for the goods are refunded only in the form of credit in the Consumer's personal profile on the Supplier's website or through the issuance of a voucher in the Consumer's name. If the consumer wishes the sums under a withdrawal from the Contract, exercised within 14 days of receiving the goods, to be refunded by money order/money transfer, then the fee for the service charged by the respective courier/postal operator is at the consumer's expense and is determined by the courier/postal operator. The Supplier cannot influence this fee, does not set it, and does not benefit from it in any way.<br>
                            If the goods for which the consumer has withdrawn from the concluded contract within 14 days of receiving the goods were paid for by card, the refund of the amount paid is made exclusively to the same card with which payment was made. If the goods for which the consumer has withdrawn from the concluded contract were paid with virtual funds from the Consumer's virtual wallet on the Platform, the refund of the amount paid is made exclusively back to the virtual wallet. This rule does not apply to virtual funds loaded into the virtual wallet by voucher, in which case the right of withdrawal applies only to the purchased voucher and within the respective periods after its purchase.</p>

                        <p><strong>(5)</strong>&nbsp;When exercising the right of withdrawal, the costs of returning the delivered goods are borne by the consumer pursuant to Art. 55, para. 2 of the CPA. The Supplier has no obligation to reimburse the additional costs for the initial delivery of the goods when the consumer has expressly chosen a method of delivery of goods other than the free standard delivery offered by the Supplier.</p>

                        <p><strong>(6)</strong>&nbsp;The Consumer undertakes to store the goods received from the Supplier on the platform and to ensure the preservation of their quality and safety during the period under para. 1.</p>

                        <p><strong>(7)</strong>&nbsp;The Consumer may exercise their right of withdrawal from the contract with the Supplier by addressing a written statement to the Supplier through the standard withdrawal form or through the module provided on the Supplier's website. The goods should be sent without cash on delivery to the Returns Department.&nbsp;Goods sent with cash on delivery will not be accepted by the Supplier.</p>

                        <p><strong>(8)</strong>&nbsp;Where the supplier on the platform has not offered to collect the goods themselves, they may withhold the reimbursement until they have received the goods back or until the consumer has supplied evidence of having sent back the goods, whichever is the earliest.</p>

                        <p><strong>(9)</strong>&nbsp;In case of delivery of goods delivered together with other goods in a set (so-called bundle goods), when exercising the Consumer's right of withdrawal under this article and the requirements of the Consumer Protection Act,&nbsp;the Consumer must return the entire set as received and in commercial condition. If some of the goods that are part of the bundle product are not subject to return according to the regulations, the Consumer agrees that the entire bundle product is not subject to return.</p>

                        <p><strong>(10)</strong>&nbsp;Regardless of the above hypotheses, the Consumer undertakes to return the goods in commercial condition. Commercial condition means a condition that allows the subsequent sale of the goods as new. Unpacking the goods should not have caused obvious violation of the commercial condition of the goods. In case of violated commercial condition of the goods, the Supplier has the right at their discretion to refuse to accept withdrawal from the contract or to charge the Consumer costs for restoring the goods to commercial condition. According to Art. 55, para. 4 of the CPA, the Consumer is liable for the diminished value of the goods resulting from their handling other than what is necessary to establish the nature, characteristics, and good functioning of the goods.</p>

                        <p><strong>(11)</strong>&nbsp;In case of exercising the right of withdrawal under this article, it is considered that the Consumer has also exercised the right of withdrawal with respect to the bonus content belonging to the goods.</p>

                        <p><strong>(12)</strong> The right of withdrawal also applies to books, only if there are no signs of use on the book and it is in preserved commercial condition, and if the book was wrapped in foil – the packaging has not been unsealed. The performance of the contract for a purchased book begins from the moment of unsealing, at which point the consumer loses their right of withdrawal and the consumer expressly agrees to this.</p>

                        <p><strong>(13)</strong> When returning the goods, the Consumer undertakes to return them together with the complete set received, as well as all accompanying documents – cash receipt, invoice,&nbsp;acceptance protocol, warranty card (if such have been issued).</p>

                        <p><strong>(14) </strong>When returning the goods, the Consumer undertakes to return all gifts received together with the ordered goods, if such have been sent by the Supplier.</p>

                        <p><strong>(15)</strong> For purchases made by a legal entity, the provisions of the Obligations and Contracts Act apply, which derogate from these General Terms and Conditions.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p class="text-center"><strong>VIII. CONTRACT PERFORMANCE</strong></p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 17. (1)</strong>&nbsp;The delivery period for the goods is determined separately for each product when concluding the contract with the consumer through the Supplier's site on the platform. For each specific product, the Consumer is informed immediately before finalizing the order on the platform approximately how many days the delivery will take. The days indicated on the platform required for delivery are approximate and the Supplier does not guarantee them, but guarantees that they will do everything possible to deliver the goods within the indicated days.</p>

                        <p><strong>(2)&nbsp;</strong>If the Consumer and the Supplier on the platform have not determined a delivery period, the delivery period for the goods is 30 calendar days from the date following the sending of the consumer's order to the Supplier through the Supplier's site on the platform.</p>

                        <p><strong>(3)</strong>&nbsp;If the Supplier on the platform cannot perform the contract because they do not have the ordered goods, they are obliged to notify the consumer and refund the amounts paid by them. In these cases, the Supplier cannot be held liable insofar as they have notified the Consumer of the depleted quantities.</p>

                        <p><strong>(4)&nbsp;</strong>The Supplier may refuse to process an order when there are reasonable doubts that the order is inauthentic, including that it does not originate from the Consumer described therein, or when the product ordered is temporarily unavailable due to depletion of quantities or other technical reasons, in which case the Supplier notifies the Consumer by email or phone and refunds the amounts paid by them. The Supplier may also refuse to process an order when the number or volume of ordered items exceeds their usual consumption by a consumer-customer within the meaning of the CPA and there is reason to believe that the order is placed for resale purposes and does not fall within the scope of a consumer purchase.</p>

                        <p><strong>(5)&nbsp;</strong>In case of inaccurate data provided by the Consumer for delivery address and phone or absence of the Consumer at the address, as well as impossibility to deliver the goods due to reasons beyond the Supplier's control, the goods are returned and remain in the Supplier's warehouses. In this case, the goods are not kept for the Consumer unless they have been paid for in advance. For goods paid in advance, they are kept for 15 days from their return, and after this period expires and if the Consumer does not collect them from the Supplier, the Supplier will return the payment received, excluding the amount spent on delivery and storage. In case of inaccurate or mistaken data provided by the Consumer for the delivery address, as a result of which the goods are sent to the wrong address, the costs for the courier service for redirecting the shipment are borne by the Consumer.</p>

                        <p><strong>(6)</strong> If the goods are not delivered to the Consumer within the indicated delivery period, the Consumer is not owed compensation. Reasons that would delay delivery beyond the days indicated on the platform are: workload and number of orders for the period above average and above usual for the Supplier; fault of the courier company such as untimely organization by the courier, excessive workload of the courier, unforeseen technical and information problems at the courier, or weather conditions preventing the courier; unforeseen technical problems in the Supplier's systems; fault of the Supplier's suppliers from whom the latter procures the product; bad weather conditions and other force majeure circumstances that would prevent the normal organizational activity of the Supplier.</p>

                        <p><strong>(7)</strong> In all cases, the Supplier guarantees and commits to deliver the goods to the Consumer with no more than 15 working days delay over the approximate delivery days indicated on the platform.</p>

                        <p><strong>(8)</strong> For products with an individual or total value of 9.99&nbsp;euros or less that fall under the "Plus Products" program, the Supplier may refuse to accept the order. If a product or products fall under the "Plus Products" program and their total value is equal to or below 9.99&nbsp;euros within the meaning of the previous sentence, the Consumer is notified through a message on the platform and is prevented from placing an order. To place an order, the Consumer must add a product or products with a total value of at least 10&nbsp;euros.</p>

                        <p><strong>(9)</strong> Delivery is made to the User's door only if the total weight of the shipment (with all its components and parts) does not exceed 15 kg. If the total weight of the shipment exceeds 15 kg, delivery is made to the ground floor of the specified address.</p>

                        <p><strong>(10)</strong> If there is no vehicle access to the delivery address, delivery is made to the point that the street allows as the final and nearest point to the delivery address.</p>

                        <p><strong>(11)</strong> If the User places an order for two or more products, each with a different delivery date and this date is more than 7 days apart, the products are delivered with separate orders for their timely receipt, unless the User specifically indicates when finalizing the order that they wish to receive them together with the last available product.</p>

                        <p><strong>(12)</strong> For products that are upcoming releases (pre-order) and/or editions, as well as limited/special editions, the Supplier does not guarantee sufficient availability for every User who has placed an order, nor does it guarantee that the products in question will be released at all, put on the market, and distributed by the Supplier, as the latter depends entirely on the manufacturer and/or publisher. If a User places an order for a product falling under the hypotheses of this paragraph and subsequently this product is not delivered to them due to insufficient availability, non-release, or non-market launch by the manufacturer or publisher, the Supplier bears no liability, only being required to notify the User of this circumstance.</p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 18.</strong>&nbsp;The Supplier on the platform undertakes to comply with all requirements established in Bulgarian legislation regarding labeling, advertising, and sale of dietary supplements.</p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 19.&nbsp;</strong>The Supplier informs the User of&nbsp;transport and courier costs&nbsp;immediately before completing the order, and the delivery price may vary depending on the product, method, and delivery address chosen by the User. In case of additional redirection of an already placed order by the User or in case of the need for a repeat visit to the declared address, the User pays the delivery price in amounts determined according to the tariff of the respective courier. The conditions for free delivery, when there are any, do not apply also if the User requests a visit to an address at a time or range of the day specified by them.</p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 20. (1)</strong>&nbsp;The User must inspect the goods at the time of delivery and handover by the courier and if they do not meet the requirements or have visible breakages and defects, refuse to accept them from the courier and immediately notify the Supplier on the platform.</p>

                        <p><strong>(2)</strong>&nbsp;If the User does not refuse the goods from the courier and does not notify the Supplier on the platform according to para. 1, the goods are considered approved as conforming to the requirements, except for hidden defects.</p>

                        <p><strong>(3)</strong> If upon delivery of the goods, the User wishes to refuse them and not accept them, the transport costs in both directions are at their expense.</p>

                        <p><strong>(4)</strong>&nbsp;If the goods purchased by the User are an e-book, the User is informed that e-books are objects of copyright according to the legislation, and any actions of unauthorized distribution constitute serious violations thereof, as well as a crime within the meaning of Section VII of the Criminal Code – crimes against intellectual property, for which crime a penalty of imprisonment of up to eight years and a fine of up to fifty thousand leva is provided.</p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 21.</strong>&nbsp;The Supplier provides the necessary service for the goods according to the provisions of Section XIII. COMPLAINTS.</p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 22.</strong>&nbsp;For cases not regulated in this section, the rules of commercial sale defined in the Commercial Act,&nbsp;the Consumer Protection Act, and the Act on Provision of Digital Content and Digital Services and Sale of Goods apply.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p><strong>IX. PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION</strong></p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 23. (1)&nbsp;</strong>The Supplier on the platform takes measures to protect the personal data of the User according to the Personal Data Protection Act.</p>

                        <p><strong>(2)</strong>&nbsp;For security reasons of the Users' personal data, the Supplier on the platform will send data only to the email address that was indicated by the Users at the time of registration.</p>

                        <p><strong>(3)</strong>&nbsp;The Supplier on the platform has the right to store data on the User's terminal communication device, unless the User expressly expresses disagreement with this.</p>

                        <p><strong>(4)</strong>&nbsp;The User or Consumer agrees that the platform Supplier has the right to send electronic messages to the User or Consumer at any time, including a newsletter or offers for purchasing goods, while the User or Consumer has a registration in the Supplier's online store on the platform.</p>

                        <p><strong>(5)</strong>&nbsp;The User or Consumer agrees that the platform Supplier has the right to collect, store, and process data on the behavior of the User or Consumer when using the Supplier's online store on the platform.</p>

                        <p><strong>(6)</strong>&nbsp;The Supplier at no time saves data for credit and/or debit card(s) used by the User when purchasing goods from the platform. The User has the option to save data for credit and/or debit card(s) used by them when purchasing goods from the platform, and the data for these credit and/or debit card(s) is not stored with the Supplier but is stored only in the system of the banking institution that issued the card in question. When saving a credit and/or debit card(s), the User must use a 3D code when intending to use the saved card again for a purchase from the platform.</p>

                        <p><strong>Art. 24. (1)</strong>&nbsp;At any time, the Supplier on the platform has the right to require the User to identify themselves and to verify the authenticity of any of the circumstances and personal data declared during registration.</p>

                        <p><strong>(2)</strong>&nbsp;If for any reason the User has forgotten or lost their name and password, the platform Supplier has the right to apply the announced "Procedure for lost or forgotten names and passwords".</p>

                        <p><strong>(3) </strong>In case of gaps regarding the protection and processing of the User's personal data, a detailed description is available in the Privacy Policy of the website.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p><strong>X. AMENDMENT AND ACCESS TO THE GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS</strong></p>

                        <p><strong>Information Regarding Exercising the Right of Withdrawal from the Contract</strong></p>

                        <p>Standard Instructions for Withdrawal:</p>

                        <p>I. Right of withdrawal from a distance contract or off-premises contract.</p>

                        <p>I. You have the right to withdraw from this contract, without giving any reason, within 30 days.</p>

                        <p>II. The withdrawal period is 30 days from the date on which you or a third party other than the carrier and indicated by you acquires physical possession of the goods.</p>

                        <p>To exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform us at the contact details indicated on our website of your decision to withdraw from the contract by an unequivocal statement (e.g. a letter sent by post, fax, or e-mail).</p>

                        <p>You may use the attached standard withdrawal form, but it is not obligatory. You may also electronically fill in and submit the standard withdrawal form or another unambiguous withdrawal statement on our website. If you use this option, we will communicate to you an acknowledgement of receipt of such withdrawal on a durable medium (e.g. by e-mail) without delay.</p>

                        <p>To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.</p>

                        <p>IV. Effects of withdrawal.</p>

                        <p>If you withdraw from this contract, we shall reimburse to you all payments received from you, including the costs of delivery (with the exception of the supplementary costs resulting from your choice of a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and in any event not later than 30 days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw from this contract. We will carry out such reimbursement&nbsp;under the conditions of Art. 16 of these General Terms and Conditions.</p>

                        <p>We may withhold reimbursement until we have received the goods back or you have supplied evidence of having sent back the goods, whichever is the earliest.<br>
                            You shall bear the direct cost of returning the goods. The cost is expected not to exceed approximately the delivery fee or standard courier service.</p>

                        <p>You are liable for any diminished value of the goods resulting from the handling of the goods other than what is necessary to establish the nature, characteristics, and functioning of the goods.</p>

                        <p>V. The right of withdrawal does not apply to&nbsp;the supply of sealed goods which were unsealed after delivery and which are not suitable for return due to health protection or hygiene reasons, as well as in other hypotheses described in the General Terms and Conditions.</p>
